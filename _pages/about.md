I was always curious about war and defense. Why do wars happen, and how do states fend against their enemies? If perpetual peace doesn’t exist, how can we ever feel safe? 

Security has always been an important lens through which I see the world. Currently expanding this worldview with an information security focus– this is the blog documenting that journey!
