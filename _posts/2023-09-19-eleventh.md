In this exercise, we are tasked to exploit the customer avatar selection feature to access the `/private` endpoint, which obviously shouldn't be accessible to the public.

Once making an account (with a fake email, for the sake of this exercise), we can access the `/customers/new-account-page` where we can select an avatar. 

Inspecting the page source of the avatar images will reveal the path to the image. 

First, let's select an avatar for ourselves, which will be displayed at the top. Next, click on the image to see the page source, and change the value to `private`.

However, this doesn't work. The website has a deny list in place, and has blocked access to the `/private` endpoint.

To get around this, we can use directory traversal to reach the blocked endpoint. Let's put `x/../private` instead of just `/private`.

This has worked, and there is no error message produced. we can click on the area with our avatar and view the page source, which now contains the contents from the `/private` directory in base64 encoding.

Decode the base64 string and we have the flag!
