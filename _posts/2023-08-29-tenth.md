### THM Exploits #1 File Inclusion

##### TryHackMe Room: Jr Penetration Tester path: Web Application Hacking: File Inclusion

#### LFI #1

1. Give Lab #1 a try to read /etc/passwd. What would the request URI be?

Answer: `includes`
We get an error message after looking up a random nonexistent file 'hi.php' 
`include(includes/hi.php) `tells us that the directory specified in the `include` function is `includes` (what a creative name).
