title: “Vulnerability Management Lab #3 Discovery Scanning & Vulnerability Scanning”
---

The actual ‘vulnerability management’ of this lab starts here, beginning with scanning and discovering what vulnerabilities there are in a target system. Exercises 2 and 3 are about running scans of Metasploitable with Tenable Nessus to do just that.

### **Exercise 2: Discovery Scan**

First, perform a discovery scan to let Nessus know of the host(s) it will scan, for this lab the Metasploitable host. Click ‘New Scan’, select ‘Host Discovery’ and simply input the IP address of the Metasploitable host. Save and Play.

**Question 2.1**

By default, what “ping methods” are used by a Nessus host discovery scan?

**Answer**

TCP, ARP, ICMP. This is shown in the ‘DISCOVERY’ section in the settings of the host discovery scan:

**Question 2.2**

What are the two Nessus plugins triggered by the Nessus host discovery scan? 

**Answer**: 

‘Nessus Scan Information’ (Plugin #19506) and ‘Ping the remote host’ (Plugin #10180).

**Question 2.3**

Does the host discovery scan perform “Credentialed checks”? How can you confirm this within Nessus? 

**Answer:** 

As shown in the last line, no, it doesn’t perform credentialed checks.

**Question 2.4**

What ping method was successful in identifying the live Metasploitable host?

**Answer**: 

Possibly ARP. As shown in the second line in ‘Output’: The host replied to an ARP who-is query.

### **Exercise 3: Vulnerability Scanning**

In this step, I scan the actual vulnerabilities. This exercise goes over both credentialed and uncredentialed scans, their difference simply being whether or not the scan is equipped with credentials to log into and access the system being scanned. Generally, credentialed scans yield more results and are more trustworthy, so credentials should be provided whenever possible.

1. **Uncredentialed scan**

2. **Credentialed scan**

For the credentialed scan, I provided the msfadmin/msfadmin SSH credentials for Metasploitable.

**Question 3.1**

What different severities does Nessus report for vulnerabilities? 

**Answer:**

5; Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational. With some labeled as ‘mixed.’

**Question 3.2**

Given just the uncredentialed scan, what is the most severe vulnerability according to Nessus? Why has Nessus given this vulnerability this rating? 

**Answer:**

UnrealIRCd Backdoor Detection (Plugin #46882) was given a VPR (Vulnerability Priority Rating) of 7.4, which was the highest in my output.

**Question 3.3**

Now, according to the credentialed scan results, what is the most severe vulnerability according to Nessus? Why does this vulnerability have a higher VPR severity score than the previously identified vulnerability? 

**Answer**:

Bash Remote Code Execution (Shellshock) (Plugin #77823) was the most severe vulnerability, with a VPR of 9.5.

**Question 3.4**

Using what plugin(s) can we validate that the credentialed scan was successful in logging into the target system. 

**Answer**:

I only found the Plugin SSH Password Authentication Accepted #149334, but 

Plugin #117887, “Local Checks Enabled”, Plugin #141118, “Target Credential Status by Authentication Protocol - Valid Credentials Provided” also signal successful log-in.

**Question 3.5**

The credentialed scan was successful in logging into the target Metasploitable system, but had some issue performing everything it was trying to accomplish. What happened here? 

**Answer**

I couldn’t find the answer to this after clicking on some vulnerabilities and checking their contents. 

The answer is, 

Plugin #110385, “Target Credential Issues by Authentication Protocol - Insufficient Privilege” tells us that the credentials I provided were insufficient to perform some of Nessus’ checks.

So,

**Reflection:**

Need to find out what practices are in place to go through all these vulnerabilities. With all this time in my hand and much to learn, I wouldn’t mind going through all 60 to 80 or so vulnerabilities per scan one by one, at least just for this lab, but it would be extremely inefficient if this were my job. Or, does every vulnerability need my attention to see what’s happening under the hood? I guess I’ll figure this out in the following exercises.
