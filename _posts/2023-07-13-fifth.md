title: "VM Lab #2 Networking Tools"
---



I finally overcame my computer-less situation. It wasn’t easy because I was going to use my dad’s new MacBook Air for my lab, until I realized that too many programs were incompatible with the M1 architecture.  In the end, I resorted to my old LG laptop just for the lab exercises. It's an old machine, but gotta make do with what I have. 

Anyway, time for the real thing. 

Over 3 or 4 sessions, I played around with the following networking tools:

- tcpdump
- ping
- hping3
- traceroute
- nmap

1. **Ping**

First, I pinged the Metasploitable IP from Kali and vice versa to confirm connectivity.

2. **Tcpdump** 

I had tcpdump running in a separate terminal (left) to see packet outputs in real time while I tested out other networking tools in another terminal (right) .

<pre>
  
</pre>

	<p>03:30:04.276072 IP 192.168.144.128.2557 > 192.168.144.129.22: Flags [S], seq 1354827860, win 512, length 0 
	03:30:04.276780 IP 192.168.144.129.22 > 192.168.144.128.2557: Flags [S.], seq 3288894494, ack 1354827861, win 5840, options [mss 1460], length 0 
	03:30:04.276904 IP 192.168.144.128.2557 > 192.168.144.129.22: Flags [R], seq 1354827861, win 0, length 0
	</p>



\> This output in the left terminal shows: Flags [S] means that a SYN flag sent out by Kali to Metasploitable, the second Flags [S] means that SYN/ACK was sent as a response from Metasploitable to Kali, and the third Flags [R] is a RST, closing up the connection.

3. **Hping3**

Hping3 is a versatile tool used for network scanning, packet crafting, and security testing purposes.

![image5]({{site.url}}/images/2023-07-13-fifth/image5.png)

Running netstat -tulpn on Metasploitable gave me a list of all the services.

<pre>
  
</pre>

	$ sudo hping3 -S -c 1 -p 53 192.168.144.129  
	[sudo] password for kali: 
	HPING 192.168.144.129 (eth0 192.168.144.129): S set, 40 headers + 0 data bytes 
	len=46 ip=192.168.144.129 ttl=64 DF id=0 sport=53 flags=SA seq=0 win=5840 rtt=15.8 ms
	--- 192.168.144.129 hping statistic --- 1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max = 15.8/15.8/15.8 ms
Running hping3 for port 53 on the Kali instance shows that it is responding to SYN packets from the scanner host.


4. **Traceroute**

This step in the guide was to traceroute my router’s IP from the Kali host.

This was where it got confusing because my results didn’t align with the guide.

The traceroute command to my router looked like this: 

![image2 copy]({{site.url}}/images/2023-07-13-fifth/image2 copy.png)

This didn’t seem right. 

Through some research, I found out that the asterisks (***) meant that traceroute did not receive a response within the defined time period.

I guessed having both my Kali scanner configured in NAT mode was the problem. And indeed, this did seem to be the case. When in NAT, the router could have problems tracing back to the VM’s private IP address, which is hidden from the external network. The host system, acting as a NAT gateway, handles the translation of the incoming packets instead.

— 

I saw on some forums that Bridged mode was not recommended on Metasploitable as it would put the VM as an independent entity on the physical network. To me, it just sounded unsafe. Most importantly, putting both VMs on bridged mode didn’t seem to solve any issues. 

Host mode would cut off all connection to external services so it was out of the question.

I decided to go with the guide’s recommendation to have all VMs configured in NAT and just be content with having learned the different network modes of virtualization software and the basics of traceroute.

5. **Nmap** 

Another useful tool for discovering hosts, services and scanning ports.

### **Exercise 1 Questions**

**Question 1.1**

What protocol does Kali use when you run traceroute against your Metasploitable host? (TIP: Try using tcpdump to investigate.)

![image3]({{site.url}}/images/2023-07-13-fifth/image3.png)

**Answer**

UDP!

**Question 1.2**

What port does ping use? 

![image4]({{site.url}}/images/2023-07-13-fifth/image4.png)

**Answer**

Ports are a transport layer concept. 

Because ping uses the ICMP, a network layer protocol, it doesn’t use any ports.

**Question 1.3**

How can you send a UDP packet to port 69 (of the Metasploitable box) using hping3? What is returned from Metasploitable as a result of this packet? Why is this the response? 

![image1]({{site.url}}/images/2023-07-13-fifth/image1-9253170.png)

**Answer**

Nothing is returned because UDP is a connectionless protocol

Observed: tcpdump outputs go on until stopped (^C). 

**Question 1.4**

When using traceroute targeting your home router, what is the TTL of the first packet sent by traceroute? What is returned in response to this packet and from what device? 

**Answer**

![image2]({{site.url}}/images/2023-07-13-fifth/image2-9253077.png)

The TTL is first set as 1, which is decremented by the first hop and helps identify the path and time taken by the packet’s travel. By incrementing the TTL and observing the responses, traceroute provides information about the path packets follow across the network.

**Question 1.5**

By default what ports does Nmap scan? How can you configure Nmap to scan all ports? 

**Answer**

By default, Nmap scans the top 1000 ports, but you can make it scan all 65,535 TCP ports.

The guide used `nmap -p0-65535 TARGET`, but `nmap -p- TARGET` will also execute the scanning of all ports.
