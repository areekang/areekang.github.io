### **Exercise 4: Scanning Enrichment**

This exercise is all about configuring settings to make the VM process more efficient and effective. 

Open the credential scan, then click on the “Configure” button on the top right hand side.

The first step:

**1. Automation & Scheduling.**

1. Click “Schedule” under “Basic” on the left side-tab
2. Toggle “Enabled”
3. Set schedule for the scans to run.

I set my scans to run every week on Friday (arbitrarily).

**2. Notifications & Filters**

1. Click “Notifications” under “Basic” 
2. In “Email Recipient(s)”, provide email address to receive alerts on vulnerabilities
3. In “Results Filters”, add filters so that notifications are set only when certain criteria are met.

**3. Reporting**

1. Click “REPORT” on the left side-tab.
2. Uncheck the box for “Show missing patches that have been superseded” 

This will remove false-positives that unnecessarily alert for superseded patches.

**4. Advanced**
1. Click on “ADVANCED” on the left side-tab
2. Change “Scan Type” drop down to “Custom”
3. Click on “General” below “Advanced” 
4. Uncheck “Enable safe checks”

Disabling “Enable safe checks” requires great caution because it means the scan can use certain plugins that are highly invasive and inflict negative effects on the system or scan. This includes denial of service (DoS) and other kinds of crashes. Despite this, it also adds additional tests that weren’t otherwise being run, thus, more potential issues can be identified.

More info [here](https://www.tenable.com/blog/understanding-the-nessus-safe-checks-option) for when to enable/disable safe checks.



### **Questions**

**Question 4.1**
Vulnerability scans can by nature be somewhat network-intensive. In the event that a host being actively scanned becomes unresponsive, something like Nessus could DoS the system even further. What can be configured within the scan to prevent this from happening? 

**Answer**
Within the “ADVANCED” settings, enable the “Stop scanning hosts that become unresponsive during scan” option.

There is also the option to slow down the scan when network congestion is detected and configure performance to decrease load on the system:

**Question 4.2**
What is the default user-agent for Nessus web application scanning. 


**Answer**: 
Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0)

This is found under “ASSESSMENT” when “Scan Type” is set to “Custom” you can choose your own assessment settings. Click on “Web Applications” and see settings for the user-agent as well as the [web crawler](https://docs.tenable.com/vulnerability-management/Content/Scans/AssessmentSettings.htm?Highlight=Web Crawler#Web_Applications).

**Question 4.3**
What type of port scanning does Nessus perform by default? 


**Answer:**
SYN.

Click on “DISCOVERY” and toggle the different “Scan Type” options to “Custom.” This will trigger new option sidebars on the left such as “Host Discovery”, “Port Scanning”, “Service Discovery”, etc. 

Clicking on “Port Scanning” will show the following screen:

 only SYN is checked by default, and TCP and UDP are unchecked.
