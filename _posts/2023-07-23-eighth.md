### Exercise 5: Reviewing/Analyzing Results


In this exercise, I filter the results down to see what vulnerabilities are at the highest risk of being exploited and analyze them.

1. **Applying filters: exploitable vulnerabilities** 

Applying a filter where exploit available is equal to true, we see the 10 vulnerabilities that are immediately exploitable:

2. **Applying more filters**

The above results can be further filtered down like so:

The filters applied here are: 

- Exploit Available is equal to true.
- Severity is equal to critical.
- Plugin Family is equal to Gain a shell remotely.



The results are narrowed down to this:

**### Questions** 

**Question 5.1**

What is the CVSS vector for the Shellshock vulnerability? What does “AC:L” mean within that CVSS vector?

![img](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XU1zB7FU_iiK839vZHbzgfqWlZxxN_Gsgy2NOdMOE4hALqNKU-fw_1dxM0n-Jz1SRnxyBXIFkOCueRZBvdhB0BMKuyLPp6Th3NhH35wOMPgTkgpUymMmjsPY6qrRwfoN8mi-5QOcA0JSKaFEu7GCMFk)

**Answer:** In the right hand side, we can locate ‘Risk Information’ that shows the VPR and CVSS score results.

The CVSS v3.0 Vector is CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:NS:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.

A [CVSS Vector](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator) is just a textual representation of the metric values used to determine the CVSS Score. 

The AC stands for ‘Access Complexity’ and the L indicates ‘Low’. Other elements in this CVSS Vector include: 

- Access Vector (AV): Network (N)
- Privileges Required (PR): None (N)
- User Interaction (UI): None (N)
- Scope (S): Unchanged (U)
- Confidentiality Impact (C) : High (H)
- Integrity Impact (I): High (H)
- Availability Impact (A): High (H)

**Question 5.2**

How did Nessus determine that Metasploitable was vulnerable to Shellshock?

**Answer:** In “Output”, we can see that


<pre>
    </pre> 
    
    Nessus was able to set the TERM environment variable used in an SSH connection to :
    
    () { :;}; /usr/bin/id > /tmp/nessus.1689265689

\* The [TERM environment variable](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/informix-servers/12.10?topic=products-term-environment-variable-unix) is used for terminal handling. It lets DB-Access (and other character-based applications) recognize and communicate with the terminal that you are using.

**Question 5.3**
What is the highest risk finding?

**Answer:** 
I would say it’s the “Bash Remote Code Execution (Shellshock)” (#77823).

[Shellshock](https://securityintelligence.com/articles/shellshock-vulnerability-in-depth/) allows threat actors to issue commands remotely on the target host via environment variable manipulation.

The lab [guide](https://shellsharks.com/vm-bootcamp#answer-52) points to the “Bind Shell Backdoor Detection” finding, which I can’t find in my results. With bind shell, an attacker may be listening on a remote port without any authentication being required, and try to ‘bind’ his own shell (connect) to that port once it opens. Once the connection is established, the attacker gains remote access to the victim’s system.

This vulnerability plugin implies the attacker may have had or already have access to our system without being noticed.



------



**Question 5.4**
According to Nessus, what action (mitigation/patch) should be taken to reduce the most risk on the system? 


![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/grUju3uAodiUKCB4Mp8CFf6lT2gRfiV-NbvpDK7ppkeU1yqfZjhEiLqOzO2Gfx9hkqLNV7Cp_jPm-f3ufTH_3bkbzv7HP2JWUsLLFpDWLl1v2Bb3hnY9Za-mjKvQYDIeKCUYpxRyXwH97SpLA2VkMaw)


**Answer:** As shown in the ‘Remediations’ section of the scan, ‘Ubuntu 8.04 LTS: linux vulnerabilities (USN-1105-1): Update the affected packages’ would resolve 234 vulnerabilities, according to Nessus.

Again, the guide contests this? But doesn’t elaborate.

The important thing pointed out though, is that manual analysis is important and one shouldn’t rely too much on the automated analysis provided by Nessus scanner.
