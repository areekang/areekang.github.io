### Exercise 6: Reporting


Finally, the last exercise of this lab! Here, I generate reports for the scans, which is a very easy process. Just click on “Report” on the top right-hand side and select the format and template and the report will be done in a couple of minutes.

I tried the different templates: 

- Complete List of Vulnerabilities by Host
- Detailed Vulnerabilities by Host
- Detailed Vulnerabilities by Plugin
- Vulnerability Operations

This is what ‘Detailed Vulnerabilities by Host’ looked like:

It gives a detailed summary of each vulnerability. 



The following is in the ‘Vulnerabilities by Plugin’ template:

Each line is linked to a detailed profile of the vulnerability.

**Takeaways:** 

1. These reports could be useful for a number of people/groups. In this lab, the scans were against only one host, the Metasploitable2 machine, but once VM operations are conducted in a larger corporate scale, different types of people would be interested by different types of reports. For me as a noob with no particular job responsibilities, the Vulnerabilities by Host report looked like a great way to start off making sense of the details of vulnerabilities and other technical nitty-gritties. 
2. Speaking of which, I also felt throughout the entire lab the overwhelming desire to be able to understand and analyze the output of the exercises I was doing. The exercises themselves were easy enough to follow, but it was another story to actually grasp, say, why critical vulnerabilities are actually critical, and how they are actually exploited, etc. One way to go about this, is as mentioned, go through the report generated from this exercise. However, another more hands-on idea I had while on [exercise 5](https://areekang.github.io/eighth/) was to utilize Metasploitable and actually exploit the system, starting with bind shell and reverse shell. 

Next up: scenario-based exercises and possibly scripting stuff.
